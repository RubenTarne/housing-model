abstract: "Understanding the dynamics of households becoming financially vulnerable are useful for understanding potential risk to the financial stability stemming from commercial banks' balance sheets. Two channels increasing financial vulnerability are of interest to us. Households taking on high levels of mortgage debt and homeowners dissaving in a housing boom via a housing wealth effect, diminishing their buffer to absorb income and interest rate shocks. In this paper we want to understand the relative importance of these two channels over the housing cycle. We employ an agent-based housing market model with a housing wealth effect to understand what household-types become vulnerable (and cease to be vulnerable) due to which channel and at what time in the housing cycle. We find that in several scenarios a housing wealth effect has a considerable impact on households' financial vulnerability. Moreover, heterogeneity is important as not all borrower-types are similarly affected."

# The Model

## Households' consumption

@Aladangady2017 showed that the overall housing wealth effect of 4.7% in the US is exclusively driven by households with above-median debt-service-to income ratios (DSR), which he defined as potentially credit constraint. Specificly, households with above-median DSRs have an estimated housing wealth effect of 12.7%, versus 0% for households with below-average DSRs. Similarly, @Zhang2019 finds a housing wealth effect for Dutch households with above-median debt-to-income ratios (DTI) of 10.3% versus 4.1% for households with below-median DTIs. These different responses to house price swings could be driven by a collateral or a precautionary saving channel. The collateral channel would imply that with falling house prices more credit-constraint households would have less ability to withdraw house equity, lowering their consumption spending. Similarly, households getting closer to the borrowing limit (due to falling house prices) could reduce their spending to increase their precautionary wealth [@Carroll2011]. We implement a consumption function where the housing wealth effect is mirroring these findings:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
c^{desired}_{i,t} = c_{0} + \alpha_{i} y^{m,disp}_{i,t} + \beta_{i}b_{i,t} + \gamma_{i,t} (w^{h}_{i,t} -  q_{i,t}),
(\#eq:dConsumption)
\end{equation}
```
where $c_{0}$ represents essential consumption, $y^{m,disp}_{i,t}$ monthly disposable income (i.e. after taxes and mortgage or rental payments), $b_{i,t}$ deposits, $w^{h}_{i,t}$ gross housing wealth and $q_{i,t}$ mortgage debt. $\alpha_{i}$ and $\beta_{i}$ are dependent on the on the agents' income, becoming weaker the richer the household is. This follows the observation that The financial wealth effect ($\beta_{i}$)

The financial wealth effect seems to work more directly, potentially due to it

Mortgage debt is only acquired for purchasing houses. We decide against implementing a deliberate equity-withdrawal mechanism.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
c_{i,t} = 
\begin{cases}
\text{if } b_{i,t}-( c^{desired}_{i,t} - y^{m,disp}_{i,t} )<\zeta_{i,t} y^{m,disp}_{i,t} &\text{, }c_{i,t} = c_{0} + \alpha_{i} y^{m,disp}_{i,t}\\
\text{if } c^{desired}_{i,t} < c_{0} & \text{, } c_{i,t}=c_{0}\\
\text{else } & \text{, } c_{i,t}=c^{desired}_{i,t}
\end{cases}
(\#eq:consumption)
\end{equation}
```

# Financial vulnerability over the housing cycle

We define **financial vulnerability** following @Ampudia2016. First we introduce the financial margin of a household as its monthly income, less its monthly mortgage payments and a certain amount of basic living expenses:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
FM_{i,t} = y^{\text{net}}_{i,t} - \sum m_{i,k} - BLC,
(\#eq:FM)
\end{equation}
```
where $m$ is the monthly mortgage payment, $i$ the individiual households, $t$ the period (month) and $k$ the house the mortgage is paid for. $y^{\text{net}}_{i,t}$ is the households post-tax monthly income and $BLC$ the monhtly basic living costs, calculated as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
BLC = \rho y^{\text{median}},
(\#eq:BLC)
\end{equation}
```
with $\rho$ being set for $BCL$ to correspond to the poverty line, which is usually between 40% and 70% of median income [@Ampudia2016]. If a household has a negative finanical margin, it is financially distressed, meaning, income minus the mortgage payments is not enough to meet monthly basic living expenses. Then the houseshold can only meet all its expenses for a certain period of time, depending on its deposits. We define a household as finanically vulnerable if it can cover its negative financial margin for less than eight months[^1].

[^1]: The exposure at default (EAD) in the current model calibration is `r formattable::percent(mean(outfile$"EAD Ampudia (70%BLC 8m)"))`, which is above the target value of the share of non-performing loans (like @Ampudia2016), which is at 2.4% between 2015-2019 [@EBA2019].

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
b_{i,t} < 8 \cdot FM_{i,t}
(\#eq:finVul)
\end{equation}
```
## Contributors to Financial Vulnerability

Following from our definition of financial vulnerability, households can become vulnerable if they:

-   Turn their financial margin negative (or more negative), by

    -   Losses to their income, by

        -   renting out less property (or to lower prices)

        -   Entering retirement

    -   Increases in their monthly mortgage payments, by buying (additional) property

-   Reduce their deposits below the threshold, by

    -   purchasing property (downpayment)

    -   Dissaving (induced by a wealth effect)

In the model, financial vulnerability is mainly driven by housing transactions and consumption. We define households to be *vulnerable by purchase* if they just purchased a house before becoming vulnerable (increases in monthly mortgage payments reduce the household's financial margin (Equation \@ref(eq:FM)) and downpayments deplete its deposits (Equation \@ref(eq:finVul)). Households are defined as *vulnerable by dissaving* when they dissaved the period they became vulnerable and did not just buy a house. Dissaving only occurs induced by a wealth effect if households hold no wealth (or negative wealth when their houses are "under water"), their consumption out of income is never above 100%[^2]. All other cases of households becoming vulnerable are defined as *by other*, including households experiencing a decline in their income, turning their financial margin negative.

[^2]: Households could become financially vulnerable just a few months after buying a house and we might classify them as *vulnerable by purchase.* However, while the purchase may have decreased the households' financial margin and the downpayments decreased the financial buffer, dissaving induced by positive net wealth was necessary to make the households financially vulnerable.

Figure \@ref(fig:contributorsVulnerability) shows when households become vulnerable and by what effect. This shows the *inflows* of vulnerable households and not the *stock* (see figure @ref(fig:stockVulnerable). Overall, `r formattable::percent(mean(outfile$"vulnerable by dissaving")/(mean(outfile$"vulnerable by purchase") + mean(outfile$"vulnerable by dissaving") + mean(outfile$"vulnerable by other")), digits = 1)` of households becoming vulnerable do so due to dissaving, `r formattable::percent(mean(outfile$"vulnerable by purchase")/(mean(outfile$"vulnerable by purchase") + mean(outfile$"vulnerable by dissaving") + mean(outfile$"vulnerable by other")), digits = 1)` due to purchases. The increases in vulnerabiltiy by purchses are concentrated at the upswing, where most transactions happen. More households become vulnerable when house prices are hight, although this effect is less concentrated. It shows that wealth effects have a strong effect on households' financial vulnerability.

Households cease to be financially vulnerable by:

-   Paying off their debt, by:

    -   Selling their home (for SSB and FTB agents)

    -   Regular repayment (fulfilling the 25-year mortgage contract)

    -   Death

-   Increase their deposits, by:

    -   Saving

    -   Selling property (generally the case for BTL agents)

    -   Inheriting

-   Reduce their mortgage payments, by:

    -   Selling property

    -   Paying off debt

-   Increase their income:

    -   Renting out property (BTL investors)

We classify households ceasing to be financially *vulnerable by sales* when they just sold property and ceased to be vulnerable. Those that did not just sell property and have a positive saving rate are classified as becoming *non-vulnerable by saving*. The rest --death, regular repayment, inheritance and increases in income turning the financial margin positive, but not the saving rate -- are subsumed under the label *other*.

We compare the finanically vulnerable households in our model with that of the fifth wave of the Wealth and Asset Survey (WEA). Using the same definition of financially vulnerable households presented above, the first values to compare are the share of financially vulnerable households in all households with mortgage debt. For the WEA the share of vulnerable households of all households with mortgage debt is `r formattable::percent(weighted.mean(wave_vul_weight$vulnerable, w = wave_vul_weight$Weight))` and for the model, using the same definition as introduced above, this share is `r formattable::percent(mean(outfile$"%vulHH of indebtedHH"))`.

<!-- median DSRs -->

The median DSR for non-vulnerable households in the WEA are for the `r formattable::percent(core_medians_WEA$coreIndicator[1])` for the model output `r formattable::percent(core_medians$coreIndicator[1])`, for vulnerable households these values are `r formattable::percent(core_medians_WEA$coreIndicator[2])` and `r formattable::percent(core_medians$coreIndicator[2])`, respectively[^3].

[^3]: Alternative measurement for the model is the mean of the median Age in each period - not the overall median of the Age distribution of all households over all periods (i.e. each households is recorded once per period). Then the vulnerable Age is `r round(mean(outfile$"medianAge vulHH"))`.
