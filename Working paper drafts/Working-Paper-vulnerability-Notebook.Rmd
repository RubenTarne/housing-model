abstract: "This paper explores two different channels that homeowners can become financiallly vulnerable by using an agent-based housing market model, calibrated to the UK. Two channels are of interest: Households becoming financially vulnerable by purchasing property with the help of mortgages and homeowners becoming vulnerable by their consumption decisions. We estimate these two channels' relative importance over the housing cycle and find that, interestingly, both channels are of similar importance, while at different states of the housing cycle. Moreover, the characteristics of households becoming vulnerable by these channels differ significantly. While both groups are lower-income, households financially vulnerable after the purchase of a house tend to be younger and are comparatively lowly leveraged, while households vulnerable by dissaving tend to be older and are comparatively highly leveraged. Additionally, we find strong path-depencies, i.e. that peaks of previous housing cycles influence current financial vulnerability significantly. This result This gives Policy implications - be careful when house prices are high, as financial vulnerability can increase today due to transactions in a past cycle. Households "

# Introduction

-   Households that dissave when prices are high can become financially vulnerable (more susceptible to employment shocks) and therefore a danger to economic stability

-   As most agent-based models, the model used here is not analytically solvable, which is why we run (repeated) computational simulations with plausible parameterisations to produce numerical results and then investigate the transmission channels.

-   @albacete_distribution_2016 Test the loss given default stemming from financially vulnerable households in Austria for the case of falling house prices. They built for each household They conclude that the loss given default does not increase to a

-   @Mian2013 find evidence that lower-income households and more highly leveraged households have larger marginal propensities to consume out of housing wealth. They study the housing bust from 2006 --- 2009 in the US. They find stronger declines of refinancing in ZIP codes with higher leverage. Their findings are in support of Fisher's [@fisher_debt-deflation_1933] "debt deflation".

-   @Kaplan2016 expand the analysis by @Mian2013 and confirm their findings.

-   @guerrieri_credit_2017 permanently shock consumers' borrowing capacity in a heterogeneous-agent, incomplete-market model and find that precautionary saving helps in producing a recession with low interest rates.

-   @dalessio_over-indebtedness_2016 research the evolution of financial vulnerability in Italy from 2008 to 2014. They conclude that a vulnerability measure incorporating the financial asset position of households captures financial distress of households. The measured persistence of households in states of financial vulnerability is low, but these could be partly explained by high volatility of financial assets and measurement errors in wealth. Real house prices continuously declined from 2008 until 2014.

-   The paper also connects to the literature of stress-testing households and nowcasting indicators of financial vulnerability of households. This literature is concerned with the lack of timeliness of micro household data needed to perform nowcasting @bankowska_household_2017.

    -   @peterson_household_2016 build a dynamic model connecting micro-household data with macro data to simulate future financial vulnerability under a given macroeconomic scenario. Households have simple behavioural rules and their balance sheet change over time. However, the authors do not consider a consumption response to wealth and only households that are unemployed can dissave.

-   Research question: how do the consumption decisions of households with mortgages influence financial vulnerability (of this subgroup) over the housing cycle? So we focus on financial vulnerability stemming from the housing market and debt repayments - house prices... strongly fluctuating asset prices

-   Policy implications: if consumption decisions have large influences, it is difficult to intervene. If house prices seem to be a problem, they should be tackled. Be careful wehn house prices are high. There are longer-lasting consequences of buying.

-   We find not only different stages in the cycle are important, but also different cycles -\> mortgage debt is usually held for a longer period of time, where more cycles could happen

## Households' Consumption

@Aladangady2017 found the overall housing wealth effect of 4.7% in the US to be exclusively driven by households with above-median debt-service-to income ratios (DSR), which he defined as potentially credit constraint. Specifically, households with above-median DSRs have an estimated housing wealth effect of 12.7%, versus 0% for households with below-average DSRs. Similarly, @Zhang2019 finds a housing wealth effect for Dutch households with above-median debt-to-income ratios (DTI) of 10.3% versus 4.1% for households with below-median DTIs. These different responses to house prices could be driven by a collateral or a precautionary saving channel. The collateral channel would imply that with falling house prices more credit-constraint households would have less ability to withdraw house equity, lowering their consumption spending. Similarly, households getting closer to their borrowing limit (due to falling house prices) could reduce their spending to increase their precautionary wealth [@Carroll2011]. We implement a desired-consumption function mirroring these findings:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
c^{desired}_{i,t} = c_{0} + \alpha_{i} y^{m,disp}_{i,t} + \beta_{i}b_{i,t} + \gamma_{i,t} (w^{h}_{i,t} -  q_{i,t}),
(\#eq:dConsumption)
\end{equation}
```
where $c_{0}$ represents essential consumption, $y^{m,disp}_{i,t}$ monthly disposable income (defined as $y_{i,t} - \sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i,k}$), $b_{i,t}$ deposits, $w^{h}_{i,t}$ gross housing wealth and $q_{i,t}$ mortgage debt. $\alpha_{i}$ is dependent on the on the agents' income (specifically their income percentile assigned at "birth" $\Xi_{i}$), becoming weaker the richer the household is, while first-time buyer agents have an extra saving motive to save up for a downpayment[^1]. $\beta_{i}$, like $\alpha_{i}$ gets weaker the higher the households' income [@Dynan2004; @Arrondel2019].

[^1]: First-time buyers with $\Xi_{i} >$ `r properties_file$minIncomePercentile` have marginal propensity to consume out of disposable income ($\alpha_{i}$) of `r properties_file$MPCForFirstTimeBuyers`. See chapter \@ref(calibration) in the Appendix for the calibration of these values.

$\gamma_{i,t}$ is the effect of net housing wealth on consumption. If the households DSR is above the median, $\gamma_{i,t} = 0.01$ (which adds up to a yearly value of 12.7%). The households DSR is defined as the sum of monthly mortgage payments over its income $\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i,k} / y_{i,t}$.

The desired consumption is subject to certain constraints:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
c_{i,t} = 
\begin{cases}
\text{if } b_{i,t}-( c^{desired}_{i,t} - y^{m,disp}_{i,t} )<\zeta_{i,t} y^{m,disp}_{i,t} &\text{, }\beta_{i}, \gamma_{i,t} = 0\\
\text{if } c^{desired}_{i,t} < c_{0} & \text{, } \alpha_{i}, \beta_{i}, \gamma_{i,t} = 0\\
\text{else } & \text{, } c_{i,t}=c^{desired}_{i,t}
\end{cases}
(\#eq:consumption)
\end{equation}
```
where the first condition states that households do not consume more than their current disposable income (after taxes and mortgage/rental payments) if it would bring their deposits below a precautionary value ($\zeta_{i,t} y^{m,disp}_{i,t}$)[^2], which is $0$ if the household has a DSR above the median. The second condition states that households always consume $c_{0}$, even if their desired consumption is below that (for instance due to large negative housing wealth).

The new parameters introduced into the base model [@Baptista2016] are given in Table \@ref(tab:parameters). Apart from these new parameters, we re-calibrated the commercial bank's internal LTV caps for the different agent classes to match the stylized facts. There are no empirical statistics on these caps and the Bank of England is currently not enforcing LTV caps themselves. As LTV caps have strong effects on the housing market dynamics [Reference Working Paper 1] they are included in the calibration.

The model is calibrated[^3] to match specific stylized facts from the UK housing market which are important for estimating the effect of housing transactions and dissaving on financial vulnerability. These include the Bank of England's *Core Indicators for setting the LTV and DTI ratios* [@BoE2018, p. 68] shown in Table \@ref(tab:BoECoreIndicators). Additional stylized facts with focus on the wealth distribution and the characteristics of financially vulnerable households are taken from the ONS and the Wealth and Asset Survey, reported in Table \@ref(tab:CoreIndicators).

[^3]: We first set upper and lower limits for the parameters in Table \@ref(tab:parameters) and then used a Latin Hypercube to sample 1000 different parameter combinations which we ran the model with. The outputs were rated with help of an (unweighed) cost function of the quadratic distance from the target values. From this array of models we selected one matching the stylized facts as good as possible.

While we are not able to match all stylized facts, none of our indicators are critically off target. The model's output is in bounds of the reported Bank of England's Core Indicators' values (Table \@ref(tab:BoECoreIndicators)) with the exception of the slightly too-high average debt-to-income ratio (DTI) of Owner-Occupiers (encompassing first-time buyers and second-and-subsequent buyers), the too-high monthly purchases of buy-to-let (BTL) agents, and rental yield. As in the model BTL agents rarely become financially vulnerable, even with this higher turnover, this should not distort our analysis much.

As we are making statements about the importance of a wealth effect channel on financial vulnerability we have to make sure that the households vulnerable in our model are similar to those in the UK. Therefore, we compare the model's output with the fifth wave of the Wealth and Asset Survey (WAS), using the same definition of financial vulnerability as presented in chapter \@ref(financial-vulnerability).

Figure \@ref(fig:DSRWAS) shows the debt-service-to-income ratio distributions for financially vulnerable and non-vulnerable households in the WAS (left panel) and model (right panel). The median DSR of non-vulnerable households is `r formattable::percent(core_medians_WAS_DSR$coreIndicator[1], digits = 1)` in the WAS and `r formattable::percent(core_medians_DSR$coreIndicator[1], digits = 1)` in the model. Financially vulnerable households' DSR is `r formattable::percent(core_medians_WAS_DSR$coreIndicator[2], digits = 1)` in the WAS and `r formattable::percent(core_medians_DSR$coreIndicator[2], digits = 1)` in the model[^4]. While median DSRs of the model and WAS are very close together, the model's DSRs are more spread out with higher density at very low and high values. We will discuss the potential consequences on the results in the conclusion. The figure shows another important relationship, namely the share of financially vulnerable households in all households with mortgage debt[^5]. For the WAS the share of vulnerable households of all households with mortgage debt is `r formattable::percent(share_vul_HH_payment_subgroup, digits = 1)` and for the model, using the same definition as introduced above, this share is `r formattable::percent(mean(outfile$"%vulHH of indebtedHH"), digits = 1)`.

[^4]: An alternative measurement for the model is the mean of the median DSR in each period - not the overall median of the DSR distribution of all financially vulnerable households over all periods (i.e. each households is recorded once per period). The DSR of vulnerable households is then `r formattable::percent(mean(outfile$"vulHH medianDSR"), digits = 1)`. This measurement is also used in table \@ref(tab:CoreIndicators).

[^5]: More specifically, due to data limitations we only take the sub-group of interviewed households with recorded mortgage payments into account, as we need those to calculate their financial margin. They make up `r formattable::percent(share_wave_5_payment, digits = 0)` of all indebted households interviewed. Both sub-groups seem to be quite similar, while those reporting specific monthly mortgage payments tend to be a bit younger (median age is `r wave_5_payments_T_F_Age%>%filter(MortgagePaymentsRecorded == TRUE)%>% select(coreIndicator)` instead of `r wave_5_payments_T_F_Age%>%filter(MortgagePaymentsRecorded == FALSE)%>% select(coreIndicator)`). Assuming the share of vulnerable households would be the same in the sub-group with and without recorded mortgage payments, the share of financially vulnerable households of *all* households would be `r formattable::percent(share_wave_5_VulHH_AllHH, digits = 1)` -- in the model this share is `r formattable::percent(mean(outfile$"nVulHH (X*medIncome Y*m)" / outfile$TotalPopulation), digits = 1)`.

<!-- median Age -->

Another important stylized fact is to match the age distribution of vulnerable and non-vulnerable households. Since with retirement the model's households' income falls significantly at age 65, a higher share of vulnerable households here (as opposed to the WAS) could imply an overestimation of dissaving on financial vulnerability, driven by drops in income. In the model, the age of financially vulnerable households is driven by both the saving motive for first-time buyers (stronger motive leads to younger households entering the market) and the maximum age by which a household has to repay her mortgages (the higher the maximum age, the older financially vulnerable households tend to be). In the WAS the median age for financially vulnerable and non-vulnerable households is equally `r round(core_medians_WAS_Age$coreIndicator[1], digits = 0)`. The median age for non-vulnerable households in the model is `r round(core_medians_Age$coreIndicator[1], digits = 1)` and `r round(core_medians_Age$coreIndicator[2], digits = 1)` for vulnerable households. The model's age distribution shows higher density at the lower tail, with more households vulnerable below 30 years and has a cluster between 50 and 60 years, where the WAS seems to have a cluster around 50 years.

The rest of the empirical values, which are presented in Table \@ref(tab:CoreIndicators), are matched remarkably well.

# Results

With the model matching a wide range of stylized facts we can look at the dynamics and drivers of financial vulnerability.

## Financial Vulnerability

We define **financial vulnerability** following @Ampudia2016. First we introduce the financial margin of a household as its monthly income, less its monthly mortgage payments and a certain amount of basic living expenses, set to the poverty line:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\text{financial margin}_{i,t} = y^{\text{net}}_{i,t} - \sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i,k} - \rho y^{\text{median}}_{t},
(\#eq:FM)
\end{equation}
```
where $\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i,k}$ is the sum of the monthly mortgage payments (which are constant over their individual repayment period), $i$ the individual household, $t$ the simulation period (month) and $k$ the house the mortgage is paid for. $y^{\text{net}}_{i,t}$ is the households post-tax monthly income and $\rho y^{\text{median}}_{t}$ is the poverty line where $\rho$ is set to 70% of median income [@Ampudia2016][^6].

[^6]: This definition of basic living expenses is different from the model's households' minimum consumption $c_{0}$, which equals the minimum personal allowance for a married couple and is . In the model households can - therefore - consume less than this relative poverty line. For instance low-icnome households could be induced to deleverage in an economic downturn

If a household has a negative financial margin, it is financially distressed, meaning, income minus the mortgage payments is not enough to meet monthly basic living expenses. If the households cannot, from income and deposits, service its payments for less than eight months we consider it to be financially vulnerable[^7].

[^7]: $\rho$ is set to `r vul_rho`. The exposure at default (EAD) in the current model calibration is `r formattable::percent(mean(outfile$"EAD Ampudia (X*medIncome Y*m)"), digits = 1)`, which is above the target value of the share of non-performing loans (like @Ampudia2016), which is at 2.4% between 2015-2019 [@EBA2019].

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
b_{i,t} < 8 \cdot |\text{financial margin}_{i,t}|
(\#eq:finVul)
\end{equation}
```
## Causes for Financial Vulnerability

Following from our definition of financial vulnerability (chapter \@ref(financial-vulnerability)), households run the risk of becoming financially vulnerable when they a) turn their financial margin negative or b) reduce their deposits below the defined threshold.

In the model, the behaviour of households driving financial vulnerability most are property transactions and consumption. Purchases reduce the household's financial margin (Equation \@ref(eq:FM)) by increases in monthly mortgage payments and downpayments deplete its deposits (Equation \@ref(eq:finVul)). We define households to be *vulnerable by purchase* -- or vulnerable by the purchase channel -- when they become vulnerable by act of a property purchase, i.e. immediately after. Dissaving only affects the deposits of households, not their financial margin. Here, households are defined as *vulnerable by dissaving* (or via the dissaving channel) when they were dissaving the period they became vulnerable (and did not buy a house at the same time)[^8]. Dissaving only occurs induced by a wealth effect as consumption induced by income ($\alpha_{i}$ in Equation \@ref(eq:dConsumption)) is never larger than the household's disposable income. All other cases of households becoming vulnerable are defined as *by other*, including households experiencing a decline in their income, turning their financial margin negative.

[^8]: Households can become financially vulnerable just a few months after buying a house. Due to this temporal closeness we might classify them as *vulnerable by purchase*, too*.* However, while the purchase may have decreased the households' financial margin and the downpayments their financial buffer, dissaving induced by positive net wealth was necessary to make the households financially vulnerable.

Figure \@ref(fig:stockVulnerable) shows the stock of financially vulnerable households, divided up by the cause for their vulnerability, over a representative house price cycle. Both effects are substantial, while households becoming financially vulnerable by dissaving make up on average `r formattable::percent(mean(outfile$"nowVul Dissaving") / (mean(outfile$"nowVul Purchase") + mean(outfile$"nowVul Dissaving") + mean(outfile$"nowVul Other")), digits = 1)` of all vulnerable households, `r formattable::percent(mean(outfile$"nowVul Purchase") / (mean(outfile$"nowVul Purchase") + mean(outfile$"nowVul Dissaving") + mean(outfile$"nowVul Other")), digits = 1)` are vulnerable by purchases, suggesting a strong impact of a collateral/precautionary saving channel on overall financial vulnerability. While the overall share of financially vulnerable households follows the house price cycle with a small lag, interestingly, both effects peak at different points of the housing cycle. The share of households vulnerable by purchases peaks around the middle of the upswing, where housing market turnover is highest (see the market turnover in Figure \@ref(fig:turnover) in the Appendix). The share of households vulnerable by dissaving peaks around the midpoint of the house price downturn[^9].

[^9]: Calculated over the course 10 Monte-Carlo runs the maximum correlation of overall vulnerability is `r round(ccf(outfile$"nVulHH (X*medIncome Y*m)", outfile$"Sale HPI")$acf[which.max(ccf(outfile$"nVulHH (X*medIncome Y*m)", outfile$"Sale HPI")$acf)],digits = 2)` at a lag of `r round(ccf(outfile$"nVulHH (X*medIncome Y*m)", outfile$"Sale HPI")$lag[which.max(ccf(outfile$"nVulHH (X*medIncome Y*m)", outfile$"Sale HPI")$acf)],digits = 2)` months.

Financial vulnerability decreases by households either increasing their financial margin or deposits. Similar to the classification above, we divide the economic actions of households reducing financial vulnerability into *non-vulnerable by sales* -- when they just sold property and ceased to be vulnerable -- and *non-vulnerable by saving* -- when they have a positive saving rate and did not just sell property. The rest --death, regular repayment, inheritance and increases in income turning the financial margin positive, but not the saving rate -- are subsumed under the label *other*.

Figure \@ref(fig:contributorsVulnerability) shows the causes for increases and decreases in the share of financially vulnerable households. The red line shows the overall resulting change of the share of vulnerable households. As already mentioned above, in the house price upswing the overall increase in financial vulnerability is driven by purchases. The reason this increase is not stronger is due to both financially vulnerable households selling property and saving up deposit-buffers. The saving channel here consists mainly of households becoming vulnerable by purchases but with high enough income to save up above the vulnerability threshold quickly. The saving channel reducing vulnerability is dominant in most parts of the cycle. From around the midpoint of the house price downturn on the saving channel is stronger than the dissaving channel leading to reductions in overall vulnerability. Here, not only the share of households vulnerable by purchases declines but also those vulnerable by dissaving.

## Characteristics of Financially Vulnerable Households

To understand which households become financially vulnerable we look at the households' characteristics. Figure \@ref(fig:distributionsVulHH) shows the age, debt, income and DSR distributions (by their density curves) of indebted non-vulnerable and vulnerable households. What emerges are clear differences between these two groups as well as between households vulnerable by purchases and vulnerable by dissaving. The age distributions show that households vulnerable by purchases tend to be significantly younger than non-vulnerable indebted households, while households vulnerable by dissaving tend to be significantly older. Taking the characteristics of nominal debt, Income and DSRs into account, households vulnerable by purchases tend to be younger and hold less (nominal) debt than the other groups. Even with their low income this debt results in clearly below-average DSR ratios. Households vulnerable by dissaving tend to be older than other indebted households. They hold higher amounts of mortgage debt, which -- combined with their low income -- results in very high DSRs. As the median DSR of all indebted households is on average `r line_results[["medianDebtServiceRatio"]]` most of those vulnerable by dissaving end up above the set threshold where housing wealth affects their consumption, i.e. where they are considered *credit-constrained*.

The cause for these different characteristics between the two groups of financially vulnerable households can be found in the amount of deposits they hold when they buy property. Panel (e) shows the deposits a households held when they bought their last property. Households vulnerable by dissaving hold generally significantly higher deposits before they purchased their last property. This allows them to pay larger downpayments and by that take on more (nominal) debt, leading to higher DSRs. Moreover, they do not use all of their deposits as downpayment, granting a financial buffer[^10]. This initial difference in deposits arises either due to saving -- simply by entering the housing market later on (remember that income of households vulnerable by purchase and dissaving are very similar, while households vulnerable by dissaving tend to be older) or due to revenues from selling property. As shown in panel (f), households vulnerable by dissaving purchase property more frequently at higher prices, because first, they have the means to buy more expensive homes, and second -- as these households are often second-and-subsequent buyers -- they have to sell their current home first, before they can buy a new one. Often, they are stuck in the offer position until the housing market turnover is very high, i.e. when house prices are already higher as well.

[^10]: Note here that households can become first vulnerable by purchases and -- if in between they ceased to be vulnerable --become vulnerable by dissaving later on.

As is shown in more detail in Chapter \@ref(financial-vulnerability-by-agent-class) in the Appendix, the differences in the vulnerability-group characteristics align to a large extent with the different agent classes. Second-and-Subsequent buyers tend to be vulnerable by dissaving rather than First-time buyers which tend to be vulnerable by purchases. Note here that buy-to-let investors are rarely vulnerable at all, due to their higher income.

## Path Dependency of Financial Vulnerability

Financial vulnerability is subject to considerable path dependency. First, there are a considerable amount of households staying financially vulnerable for most of their mortgage repayment period

```{r loadValuesPathDependency, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE}
period_to_filter <- c(trough_period[11],trough_period[11]+50)
```

The last part of the analysis focuses on the question what households tend to stay financially vulnerable for longer periods of time and why. The left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:whenVulBuy) maps the households vulnerable at the beginning of the house price upswing according to when (x-axis) and at what price levels (y-axis) they bought their last property. The horizontal line marks the present period (period `r period_to_filter[1]`). Both, households vulnerable by dissaving (yellow dots) and by purchases (green dots) have predominantly bought their last property at rater low prices (below 0.4). It shows that a significant part of the households vulnerable today have been vulnerable for one up to two house price cycles. Specifically, this is true for households vulnerable by purchase, as by our definition these became vulnerable directly from the purchase of property. However, households vulnerable by dissaving, that bought a long time ago at low prices tend to be vulnerable for a long time as well (see Figure \@ref(fig:vulSince) in the Appendix).

Table \@ref(tab:vulnerbilityTable) test.

The right panel of Figure \@ref(fig:whenVulBuy) shows the financially vulnerable households `r period_to_filter[2] - period_to_filter[1]` periods later at the house price peak (marked by the dotted line). There are two major differences from low to high prices. Most households that became newly vulnerable and bought their last property between period `r period_to_filter[1]` and `r period_to_filter[2]` became vulnerable by purchase. Only very few bought property and became vulnerable only a couple of periods later due to increased consumption induced by their positive net housing wealth (the few yellow dots between both vertical lines). The other major difference can be found around periods 2225 and 2325 where a large amount of households vulnerable by dissaving appear. This tells us that with the rising house prices (between periods `r period_to_filter[1]` and `r period_to_filter[2]`) households which bought their last property at high house price levels, one or two cycles ago, now became newly financially vulnerable by dissaving. Looking at the micro data tells us that these households -- highly leveraged by the property purchase -- experienced negative equity when house prices started to drop. Negative housing wealth leads to increased saving (see Equation \@ref(eq:dConsumption)) and thereby increasing deposits as long as prices stay low. When house prices rise again, their net housing wealth turns positive, inducing the depletion of their savings. It turns out that households buying at lower price levels tend to stay financially vulnerable for longer periods of time, as they rarely experience negative housing equity, and thereby deleveraging. This is true for households vulnerable by purchase and dissaving.

In conclusion, the financial-vulnerability-channels of purchasing and dissaving work at different points of the house price cycle. The purchasing channel increases the share of vulnerable households mainly in the upswing and immediately after households buy property. The dissaving channel on the other hand is more important at high prices, where increases are rooted in purchases at previous house price peaks. This way, also households that previously became vulnerable by purchases can become vulnerable again by dissaving at a later house price peak. For both effects there is a "floor" of financially vulnerable households, consisting mainly of households that bought at low prices, therefore experiencing almost exclusively positive net housing wealth, which -- due to their above-median DSR -- leads to below-vulnerability-threshold deposits.

# Robustness Checks

The strength of the consumption channel could be sensitive to the parametrisation of the model or the definition of financial vulnerability Ampudia-measures. Moreover, different parameters used in the definition of financial vulnerability -- given the parametrisation of the model's variables -- could lead to the model not as close to the WAS data.

## Different Model Parametrisation

calibration_consChannel_param <- read.csv(here::here("statistical output R/outputsCalibrationTest_may2021.csv"))
```

To test if the strength of consumption channel is sensitive to the specification of the free parameters in \@ref(tab:parameters) we first check the average consumption channel strength from all 1000 model runs with different parameter sets the average strength of the consumption channel was at `r formattable::percent(mean(calibration_consChannel_param$vulConsumptionChannel),digits = 1)`[^11]. Next, we perform a simple linear regression. Figure \@ref(fig:modelParam) shows that the parameter of the income percentile from which the

## Different Thresholds for Financial Vulnerability

Applying different thresholds for financial vulnerability, i.e. calculating basic living costs as a lower percentage of median income and defining the

-   \@ref(tab:differentAmpudia) shows that with $\rho$ set to 0.7 the model is very much able to match the WAS data. However, the strength of the consumption channel varies between 44% and 73%, depending on the deposit threshold used, with lower thresholds increasing the strength of the channel.

-   With lower $\rho$ the importance of the consumption channel increases.

-   The share of financially vulnerable households of all indebted households becomes significantly lower than in the WAS. This is mainly due to the absence of any shocks to employment income in the model.

-   The values for non-vulnerable households stay close to WAS data.

-   The values of median DSRs for vulnerable households do not increase as much as in the WAS when $\rho$ is lower. This could be driven, again, by the relatively stable incomes of the model's households.

-   As in the WAS, the median age of vulnerable households rises with lower $\rho$, albeit more strongly.

# Conclusion

This paper analysed two important channels for financial vulnerability of the household sector stemming from housing market dynamics. Purchases, as well as housing wealth effects, have been found to be central for understanding financial vulnerability dynamics. The dynamics are almost exclusively driven by owner-occupiers, investors play only a minor role. Younger households with lower deposits, tend to become financially vulnerable at the beginning of the housing market upswing due to buying their (often first) home, older households with more deposits buy their home at higher prices with higher leverage, making them susceptible to housing wealth effects (via a collateral or precautionary saving channel). This susceptibility leads to them becoming vulnerable when price levels are high and ceasing to be vulnerable when price levels are low. Overall, financial vulnerability shows strong path dependencies with households staying vulnerable over the course of several housing cycles, while others (vulnerable by dissaving) switch between financial vulnerability and non-vulnerability depending on the house price level.

The agent-based model utilised was able reproduce important stylized facts. However, it also has some shortcomings that could influence the results. House prices tend to fall to unrealistically low levels, due to missing stabilising mechanisms. This limitation could allow lower-income households to enter the housing market (earlier), thereby increasing the share of young, financially vulnerable households. The age distributions in Figure \@ref(fig:AgeWAS) suggest that this is partly the case. Another limitation of the model is the missing marcroeconomy, implying that consumption responses do not feed back into households employment income. This way we underestimate the effect of changes in income financial vulnerability.

Nonetheless, the analysis showed that the housing markets can affect financial vulnerability by two important channels, affecting different household-types differently. At the same time, the effects can be very long-lasting and levels of financial vulnerability today depend to a large extent on past purchases (as well as on current price levels).

# Financial Vulnerability by Agent-Class

Interestingly, the differences between both vulnerability channels purchases and dissaving are mirrored by the agent classes. Figure \@ref(fig:stockVulAgentClass) shows that FTB agents are almost exclusively responsible for the purchasing channel and SSB agents predominantly for the dissaving channel. BTL investors contribute almost nothing to the share of financially vulnerable households. FTB agents get more frequently vulnerable by purchases than SSB agents (while purchasing slightly fewer houses on average than SSB agents - see Table \@ref(tab:BoECoreIndicators)) due to their lower deposits. Figure \@ref(fig:flowAgentClass) shows the agent based version of Figure \@ref(fig:contributorsVulnerability).
